This repo contains a bunch of small games in C++ and some exercises in OpenGL that I did back in high school, to learn coding logic. The C++ files require "biblaureano", a custom library created by my teacher, Marcos Laureano.

Biblaureano can still be downloaded at https://sourceforge.net/projects/biblaureano/
